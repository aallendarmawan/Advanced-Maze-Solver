## Description
Ever wanted to visualise a best path from you to somewhere else, but with obstacles in the way? Now, you can use this to find out the best way. Learn about and see how different algorithms go about searching a goal, in a simple grid-like maze!

The grid acts as a palette such that you can "paint" where you want the start, goal(s) and obstacles to be placed!

Current algorithms in the latest version:
- Breadth First Search
- Depth First Search
- A* Search
- Random Walk Search

Further implementations to be considered:
- Adding other algorithms
- Having the option to toggle squares which have a certain energy level to overcome. Could be interesting when I implement an algorithm such as Greedy.
